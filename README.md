**_Inversion, eigenvalues of matrices, using Java._**

Some of Apache's matrix utility classes are used to find the inverse and the eigenvalues of matrices.  A 2 x 2 example is provided.  It's written in a way that allows for experimenting with as many different techniques as possible, but also in a way that should make adding classes and methods relatively easy.


The following two linux terminal commands...

1. _javac -classpath .:/home/USERNAME/Downloads/commons-math3-3.6.1/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar gitjavamatrix/Main.java_

2. _java -classpath .:/home/USERNAME/Downloads/commons-math3-3.6.1/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar gitjavamatrix/Main_

... will perform 'compile and run' if a) the Apache 'jar' is in 'Downloads', b) the _.java_ files are in directory called gitjavamatrix, and c) you are one directory level higher than that.
